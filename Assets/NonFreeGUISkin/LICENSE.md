To be terribly honest, I have no complete idea as to how allowed I am to redistribute this.
The skins were made by user 'shaun' from forum.unity3d.com
They included no license so I assumed it's public domain?
Anyways, the original post is here: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/custom-skins.7174/
shaun, if you are reading this feel free to tell me that I suck for releasing this :V
